      <div id="content"><div id='filecontents'>Revised Hack Assembler<br/>- written in Ruby -<br/><br/>This is an assembler for Hack assembly code for the Hack computer, as presented in the Nand-to-Tetris book.<br/>I have improved a lot since my first attempt at it last year, and felt I can finally share something that may <br/>actually help other people. With that said, I still have very much to learn, so please let me know if there&#39;s anything I can improve!<br/><br/>How to Use This:<br/>In your terminal, execute the `main.rb` file in this directory. Pass in a single file path for your source code before entering the command. The program will assemble your file and write a `.hack` plaintext file using the same path it received as input. That&#39;s all there is to it. <br/><br/>You can verify the assembler&#39;s accuracy by comparing its output to the one generated by the official assembler. Included in this folder is a small file for doing just that. You&#39;ll have to provide both files yourself but once you have them you can enter something like this:<br/><br/>`$ ruby compare.rb test_file.hack verification_file.hack`<br/><br/>It will output &quot;true&quot; if the two files are exactly the same. Be sure to check for any trailing whitespace. If one file ends with a newline and the other doesn&#39;t the result will be false.<br/><br/>While there may be slightly more error checking in this than the project requires, there isn&#39;t much. I might come back and fix that in the future, but for now it assumes you are passing in error-free code.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things I wish I had known when I first took up this project. Everything was in a single file, I didn&#39;t understand how to use or reference constant values, I was not always clear about what my code was doing (although I could still figure it out without too much trouble while making this revision). Actually, I ran my old version during testing and saw that it was even slower than this new version. I tried to show off some more advanced concepts here, but I still want it to be accessible enough so that someone might still get some insight or inspiration from it, even if they don&#39;t understand it much. Please tell me how successful I was. It is my hope that someone may find any of this useful. <br/><br/>I plan to do a Java version next, although this took almost six hours to do in my main language so that might take a while--or who knows. Maybe all the extra insight I got from this run will make the Java version easier.</div></div>
